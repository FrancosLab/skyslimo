 <Content title="About us" id="about">
   <p>We are in the business of Efficiency. Our goal is to ensure that, as our client, you get the maximum benefit from your
       driver services. We don't like to refer to ourselves simply as chauffeurs. We see ourselves more as partners. Your
       partner. As our client, we will help you accomplish your objective in anyway that we can.
       For a combined experience in excess of 20 years in the customer service, management, and operations of Private
       Aviation, also known as General Aviation, we have learned what it takes to make transportation service work
       effectively. There are many moving parts in your itinerary and it is very important that you get to where you need to go
       on-time. That is the industry standard. As your partner, we hold ourselves to a standard much higher than that. We
       strive to be your second hand. Just let us know what can make your time with us more efficient for you and we will fill
       in the rest. If you cannot think of anything, maybe we can.
       Our effectiveness is your Efficiency. You have dedicated your time to doing business in the region we call home. Allow
       us to carry you to your objective. <br/><br/><em>~Nunquam non paratus~</em></p>
